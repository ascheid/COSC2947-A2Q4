COSC2947 - C++ Object-Oriented Programming @ Algoma University | Assignment 2 Question 4

Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a specified character in a string. The function prototype is as follows:

    int count(char *s, char a)      // s is the string and a is the specified character

Write a program to test your function.  Here is a sample run:

     Enter a string:   welcome
     Enter a character:  e
     e occurs in the string 2 times
